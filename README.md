# Pokemon Clone (ongoing project)
## Demo (gif takes some time to load): ##
![](https://github.com/lcicek/pokemon/blob/master/demo.gif)
<br>
<i>Note: quality and frame rate is lowered significantly due to gif-file size constraints.</i>
## Progress: ##
Current functionalities include:
<ul>
  <li>Keyboard input processing, player movement (turning, walking, sprinting, jumping) and corresponding animations (e.g. walk cycle).</li>
  <li>Out of bounds and collision detection (for all solid objects or ledges).</li>
  <li>Object-specific display of text and text animation.</li>  
  <li>Menu navigation.</li>
  <li>Locking of new player movement during active movement/animation and active menu or dialogue screen.</li>
  <li>Window rescaling (limited to integer scale values due to blurriness of bitmap fonts when rescaled to float values).</li>
  <li>Grass animation.</li>
</ul>

### Note: ###
This project doesn't rely on any outside resources or tutorials and uses external libraries only minimally (namely for the game loop, GUI and key inputs).
