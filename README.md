# Pokemon Clone (ongoing project)
This project doesn't rely on any outside resources or tutorials and uses external libraries only minimally (namely for the game loop, GUI and key inputs).

## Progress: ##
Current functionalities includes:
<ul>
  <li>Keyboard input processing, player movement (turning, walking, sprinting, jumping) and corresponding animations (e.g. walk cycle).</li>
  <li>Out of bounds and collision detection (for all solid objects or ledges).</li>
  <li>Object-specific display of text and text animation.</li>  
  <li>Menu navigation.</li>
  <li>Locking of new player movement during active movement/animation and active menu or dialogue screen.</li>
  <li>Window rescaling (limited to integer scale values due to blurriness of bitmap fonts when rescaled to float values).</li>
</ul>
